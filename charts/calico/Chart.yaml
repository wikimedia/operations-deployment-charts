# FIXME: Disabled Kubernetes version dependency.
# I could not find a way to make helmfile pass ''--kube-version 1.31' down to helm calls.
# Without that, the current helm version in use (v3.11.3) will default to validate
# against k8s 1.26 and fail.
# kubeVersion: ">= 1.31"

# We keep the dependencies list as comment to have a trace about them.
# The way in which Helm tracks dependencies is a little convoluted
# for our use case: we deploy crds separately from the charts that depends on
# them (via helmfile). Having dependencies explicitly stated is nice
# for documentation purposes, but we should strive for a compromise
# between precision and simplicity in day-to-day ops.
