# We keep the dependencies list as comment to have a trace about them.
# The way in which Helm tracks dependencies is a little convoluted
# for our use case: we deploy crds separately from the charts that depends on
# them (via helmfile). Having dependencies explicitly stated is nice
# for documentation purposes, but we should strive for a compromise
# between precision and simplicity in day-to-day ops.
