#Lua Tests
The Lua tests use the [Busted](https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/) test framework.
It can be instlled via [luarocks](https://luarocks.org/).

The tests can be run using 
```bash
busted test.lua
```

Since the Lua code to test is generated by a helm template, it is necessary to
use a helper script to generate the code: The test file will call `get-lua.sh`
use runs `helm template` to generate the Lua code. The `values-test.yaml` file
contains stub values to be used in tests.
