# NOTE: version here is WMF's version of this chart.
# appVersion should be the upstream version.
# (We cannot use a '-wmf0' prerelease suffix in helm charts.
# Helm considers these 'development' versions.)

# This is the version number of the application being deployed (the operator). This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. The CRDs in this chart should generally be updated
