# watchNamespaces is a flink-kubernetes-operator configuration that
# indicates which namespaces flink-kubernetes-operator should manage.
# Include all namespaces that need to use the FlinkDeployment CRD.
# NOTE: You should set this to the same values in all environments
# in the same cluster_group.
watchNamespaces:
  - mw-page-content-change-enrich
  - rdf-streaming-updater

# NOTE: Ideally, we'd put rbac.create in the cluster group main.yaml values file.
# But, rbac.create is a very common value, and is used by many charts.
# We only want to modify that value in this file, which is only used by the
# flink-operator release.

# Allow the flink-kubernetes-operator chart to create RBAC resources in watchNamespaces.
rbac:
  create: true

  allowed_clusters:
    - flink-codfw

# Commented out for now, we need a newer version of Zookeeper to use Zookeeper HA with Flink.
