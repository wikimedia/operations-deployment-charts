# Defaults applied to all clusters in all cluster_groups
#
# List of namespace overrides:
# <namespace-name>:
#   readOnlyUser: string
#     Default: <namepace-name>
#     The name of the read-only user for this namespace (needs to be created via private puppet).
#   deployUser: string
#     Default: <namepace-name>-deploy
#     The name of the deploy user for this namespace (needs to be created
#     via private puppet).
#   deployClusterRole: string
#     Default: deploy
#     ClusterRole to bind the deploy user to.
#   pspClusterRole: string
#     Default: allow-restricted-psp
#     The name of the ClusterRole granting access to the PSP this namespace
#     will use.
#     Note: If the ClusterRoleBinding already exists in the namespace,
#     it will need to be deleted first and then recreated with
#     the new ClusterRole.
#   systemNamespace: bool
#     Default: false
#     Don't deploy users or resource quota into this namespace.
#     Kubernetes builtin namespaces (default, kube-.*) are always treated as
#     system namespaces for safety reasons.
#   allowCriticalPods: bool
#     Default: false
#     Critical pods in this context are pods with priorityClassName
#     set to system-cluster-critical or system-node-critical.
#     See:
#     * https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/
#     * https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/#limit-priority-class-consumption-by-default
#   labels: hash<string,string>
#     Default: {}
#     Provide a list of labels and their values to be added to the namespace.
#   tlsHostnames: list
#     Default [<namespace-name>]
#     Each namespace will have TLS certificate issued that can be used with Istio-Ingressgateway.
#     That certificate will be issued with CN <first tlsHostname>.discovery.wmnet and the following
#     subject alt names for all tlsHostnames:
#     - {{ $tlsHostname }}.discovery.wmnet
#     - {{ $tlsHostname }}.svc.codfw.wmnet
#     - {{ $tlsHostname }}.svc.eqiad.wmnet
#   tlsExtraSANs: list
#     Default: []
#     A list of additional names to be added to the SANs of the default TLS certificate that will be used by
#     Istio-Ingressgateway.
#     This is useful for names that don't match the tlsHostnames schema, like foo.wikimedia.org.
#   deployTLSCertificate:
#     Default: false when the systemNamespace flag or the isBuiltinNamespace one
#     is true, and true in all the other cases.
#     Whether or not to deploy the default TLS certificate to the istio-system namespace.
#   enableJobSidecarController:
#     Default: false
#     Whether or not to enable the sidecar controller (which terminates Jobs when the
#     application container is completed, leaving only sidecar containers).
#     No effect yet, work in progress - T348284
