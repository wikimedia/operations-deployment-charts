  # Keep resource limits in mind! For example JUST for the shellbox
  # containers, not including sidecars, 16 replicas is:
  # 128 CPUs requested/limit
  # 64GB memory requested
  # 96GB memory limit
  # Including the sidecars, the limit is effectively 160 for CPU alone

  # This number should loosely track with the mw-videoscaler
  # mercurius.workers value. The theoretical maximum of parallel jobs
  # is len(mercurius.jobs) * mercurius.workers, but in reality we'll
  # need a fudge factor of a few instances in order to satisfy
  # situations where a retiring mercurius instance still has to finish
  # a few jobs while the new worker takes over on processing new
  # jobs. The pathological case is actually twice the theoretical
  # maximum but this is unlikely to be hit if there are enough
  # existing workers processing jobs during a rollover of mw-videoscaler
