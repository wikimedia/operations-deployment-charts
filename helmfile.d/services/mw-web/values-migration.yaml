# This release exists to enable incremental capacity-based traffic migration.

# Incrementally exchange capacity between this and the "main" release in order
# to actuate the migration.
resources:
  replicas: 0

# During the early phases of a migration when the number of replicas is small,
# it may be useful to increase maxUnavailable (default: 6%) in order to improve
# deployment speed if the migration release is using a different mediawiki
# image than main (as the image is then unlikely to be cached).
# See, e.g., https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T383845#10612223.
#strategy:
#  rollingUpdate:
#    maxUnavailable: 20%

# Override local cluster name (defaults to namespace) to disambiguate in
# tracing and envoy metrics.
mesh:
  tracing:
    service_name: mw-web-migration

# Do not create a distinct service, instead routing via the main release.
service:
  deployment: none
routed_via: main
