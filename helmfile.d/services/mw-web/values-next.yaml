# This release exists to enable incremental traffic migration actuated by an
# external system, in contrast to the migration release.
# For this use case, an externally addressible discovery service distinct from
# main is required (e.g., a cookie-driven migration that selects the relevant
# discovery service at ATS).

resources:
  # NOTE: Keep 1 replica running to satisfy pybal checks, etc. when not in use.
  replicas: 34  # Scaled to 10% of main multi-DC size (T405955)

# During the early phases of a migration when the number of replicas is small,
# it may be useful to increase maxUnavailable (default: 6%) in order to improve
# deployment speed if the next release is using a different mediawiki image
# than main (as the image is then unlikely to be cached).
# As an alternative or in addition, it may be useful to temporarily increase
# the deployment timeout value in helmfile.yaml.
# See, e.g., https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T383845#10612223.
# TODO: T405955 - Temporarily increase maxUnavailable.
